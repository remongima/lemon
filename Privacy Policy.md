# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 7, 2025**

We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what information our Discord bot collects, how we use it, and how we protect it. We've written this in plain language because privacy policies shouldn't require a law degree to understand.

- We use encryption for sensitive data transmission
- Access to data is limited to authorized personnel only
- We regularly review our security practices

However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we do our best to protect your information, we can't guarantee absolute security.

## 5. Data Retention

We retain data only as long as necessary:

- Active server data is kept while the bot is in your server
- Command logs may be retained for up to 90 days for debugging purposes
- When you remove the bot from your server, most data is deleted within 30 days

You can request data deletion at any time by contacting us.

## 6. Third-Party Services

Our bot may interact with:

- Discord's API (subject to Discord's Privacy Policy)
- Hosting providers for server infrastructure
